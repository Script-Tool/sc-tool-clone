This project is a browser automation tool for managing online identities and automating tasks across social media platforms. Key features include:

  1. Browser profile management with fingerprinting controls
  2. Automated social media actions (Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, ChatGPT)
  3. CAPTCHA solving integration
  4. Content generation with AI assistance
  5. Proxy rotation to avoid detection

  The system uses Node.js with extensions for browser control, video processing (FFmpeg), and cloud storage integration. It's designed for large-scale automation with sophisticated
  anti-detection measures.
